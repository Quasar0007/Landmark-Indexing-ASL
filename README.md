# Landmark-Indexing-ASL
The entire code for Landmark Indexing and ASL algorithm is present here.

How to run this code? </br>
Download the code and run it on any text editor(lets say Sublime Text) following the steps below:-
- Open the command terminal and get relocated to the directory containing the file 'LI_Plus.py'
- On the command terminal, run the command 'python Li_plus.py'.
- Input on the first line should be the number of vertices(n), number of edges(m) and the number of labels(l) separated with spaces.
- The next n lines would contain the index of vertices namely 1,2,3.....
- The next m lines would contain the edges with each line having the index of source vertex, index of target vertex and the set of labels associated with the edge.
- The next l lines would contain all the label names , one in each line.

#Landmark-Indexing-Plus Example
Example : - For a graph with 2 vertices namely 1 and 2 with a directed edge from 2 to 1 having the label ["follow", "friend"] from a set of labels ["follow", "friend", "connection"] will be provided as input in the following way:-

- 2 1 3
- 1
- 2
- 2 1 follow friend
- follow
- friend
- connection
